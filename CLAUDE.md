# AIverse Project Development Notes

## Project Overview
AIverse is a Next.js 14 application showcasing AI tools and workflows with internationalization support (English and Chinese).

## Recent Development Progress

### 1. Homepage Layout Adjustment (Completed)
- Moved statistics section (1,000+ AI tools, 50,000+ users) below "Popular AI Tools" section
- Moved "AI Tool Combinations" section higher up on the homepage
- Updated component order in `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`

### 2. Fixed Navigation Routing Issues (Completed)
- Fixed 404 errors on `/workflows` and `/tools` routes
- Updated middleware matcher to handle all routes properly
- Created redirect pages for non-locale routes
- Updated Header component to use locale-prefixed URLs

### 3. Implemented Tool Details in Workflows (Completed)
- Created comprehensive tool data structure with 60+ AI tools
- Built tool detail modal component showing:
  - Tool description and features
  - Pricing information
  - Direct links to official websites
- Made AI tool names clickable in all workflow detail pages
- Supports both English and Chinese languages

## Key Files and Components

### Data Files
- `src/data/tools.ts` - Comprehensive AI tool database
- `src/data/workflowsData.ts` - Workflow definitions and tool combinations

### Components
- `src/components/tools/ToolDetailModal.tsx` - Modal for displaying tool details
- `src/app/[locale]/workflows/[id]/WorkflowDetailClient.tsx` - Workflow detail page with clickable tools
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Navigation header with locale support

### Routing
- `src/middleware.ts` - Handles locale-based routing
- `src/app/tools/page.tsx` - Redirect for non-locale tools route
- `src/app/workflows/page.tsx` - Redirect for non-locale workflows route

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- next-intl for internationalization
- Lucide React for icons

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

## Next Steps
Ready for the next feature implementation. The codebase is well-structured with:
- Proper internationalization setup
- Reusable components
- Comprehensive data structures
- Clean routing system

## Notes
- All workflow pages now have clickable AI tools that show details and link to official websites
- The tool data covers all tools used across the 16 different workflows
- Modal component handles body scroll locking for better UX
- Tool search is case-insensitive and handles various name formats

## AI Tool Optimization Strategy (In Progress)

### Strategy Document
- Created comprehensive optimization strategy in `AI_TOOLS_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md`
- Covers market monitoring, evaluation metrics, user feedback, and automation

### New Components Created
1. **ToolRating Component** (`src/components/feedback/ToolRating.tsx`)
   - Collects user ratings and feedback
   - Captures recommendation status
   - Allows users to suggest alternatives

2. **ToolComparison Component** (`src/components/tools/ToolComparison.tsx`)
   - Visual comparison between current and suggested tools
   - Shows improvement metrics
   - Highlights key advantages

3. **Rating API** (`src/app/api/tools/rating/route.ts`)
   - Handles rating submissions
   - Triggers evaluation for low-rated tools
   - Tracks user suggestions

4. **Monitoring Dashboard** (`src/components/admin/ToolMonitoringDashboard.tsx`)
   - Real-time tool performance metrics
   - Replacement suggestions
   - Alert system for declining tools

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Basic infrastructure setup ✅
- Phase 2: Data collection integration ✅
- Phase 3: Smart analysis algorithms ✅
- Phase 4: Automation and optimization ✅

## AI Tool Optimization System (Completed)

### Full Implementation Details

1. **Database Setup** (`src/scripts/init-tool-monitoring-db.sql`)
   - 5 main tables for tracking ratings, evaluations, and suggestions
   - Views for quick analytics access
   - Comprehensive indexing for performance

2. **External Data Sources**
   - Product Hunt integration (`src/services/external-sources/productHunt.ts`)
   - GitHub trending tools (`src/services/external-sources/github.ts`)
   - Reddit AI community monitoring (`src/services/external-sources/reddit.ts`)

3. **Tool Evaluation Engine** (`src/services/tool-evaluation/analyzer.ts`)
   - Multi-factor scoring algorithm
   - Automatic comparison with existing tools
   - Risk assessment for replacements

4. **Monitoring Service** (`src/services/tool-monitoring.ts`)
   - Aggregates data from all sources
   - Generates replacement recommendations
   - Saves results to database

5. **User Feedback Integration**
   - Rating component in workflow pages
   - Captures user satisfaction and suggestions
   - Triggers evaluation for low-rated tools

6. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Real-time metrics at `/[locale]/admin`
   - Replacement suggestions at `/[locale]/admin/suggestions`
   - Protected with simple authentication

7. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/tools/rating` - Submit ratings
   - `/api/tools/suggestions` - Manage suggestions
   - `/api/cron/monitor-tools` - Automated monitoring

8. **Automated Tasks**
   - Daily monitoring via Vercel cron
   - Configurable in `vercel.json`
